# Technical Challenge

World Tree Dice Roller Project

## Start the project

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run dev` from worldtree-diceroller folder

## Assumptions

Assumptions can be found through the code with `Assumptions: `.

## Front End Implementation

Limited front end implementation to 3 hours. Initial menu has been created and requires styling to indicated selected dice rolls in the notation. Comments have been left in the code about how I would proceed with the logic and visual updates.

## API Implementation

Ran into obstacles with NextJS. This my first time implementing axios into Next and more reading is required for best practices related to environmental variables.

## Notes on Mental State at end of eval

Doing my best to respect the four hour time crunch left me flustered at the end trying to balance a strong attention to detail versus respecting the directions. My code quality and progress in the last two hours took a hit as I was trying to rush to finish as much as I could rather than doing the best I could. Jason and the directions assurance are appreciated but pressure to do well on a technical eval in a time line is a strong motivator. In a real life scenario, I would have forced myself to take breaks at each hour interval in order to avoid or elevate the stress of the eval.

## Requested Feedback

I will greatly appreciate all feedback. In particular feedback on balancing tasks during a Full Stack with Front End focus. As Front End Developer, I try to focus a lot of detail and reusability. Often then can take up a bit too much time to then highly backend ability. On the job there is time to balance both but in the time constraints of a tech eval this can be a challenge. :)
