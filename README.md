# Technical Challenge

World Tree Dice Roller Project. The project was limited to roughly four hours with directions and priority intentionally kept vague to gauge force the candidate to prioritize.

## Start the project

1. Run `npm install`
2. .env file with the API services, `API={address}` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROLLS="$API"`
3. Run `npm run dev` from worldtree-diceroller folder

## Comments

Comments can be found in the project to note short cuts taken for the purpose of tech eval. Additionally there are comments where I would normally ask opinions or for clarity from team members as part of collaboration.

## Directions

### FULL-STACK ENGINEER WITH FRONT-END FOCUS

This technical challenge should take no more than four hours to complete. If you find yourself taking significantly longer, please submit what you have rather than working on it for a long time.

### THE CHALLENGE: Implement front-end to a Dice Roller Service

Rolling dice is a vital part of any TTRPG. World Tree needs to build a simple visual dice roller, so that users can see those digital dice rolling!
The following requirements are intentionally not 100% complete by design, and this is not intended to be part of the actual World Tree product. We are excited about how you would tackle the solution.

### FEATURE REQUIREMENTS

Implement a front-end dice roller as a Single Page Application (SPA)

1.  Must accept dice notation input
2.  Must have dice buttons to create dice rolls
3.  Must use the visual design provided
4.  Must utilize the API service specified below
5.  Must display the results of dice rolls from other users of the API in chronological order, using the socket.io broadcast
6.  Should have some form of visual dice rolling

### METHOD AND CONSTRAINTS

● You must set-up a Github repository for this challenge and make it available to World Tree to review.
○ Your code should be committed to the repository and the commit history visible.
○ Please add a meaningful summary to each commit.
● Document any assumptions you make and provide that documentation with your submission.
